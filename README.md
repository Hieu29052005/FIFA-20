# FIFA 20 Data Science Project

In this project, we will explore the **FIFA 20** dataset to analyze player statistics, performance, and potential value. The dataset is a CSV file that contain detailed information on players' attributes from the popular FIFA video game series.

## Key Objectives:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Drop unnecessary columns to focus on essential features.
   - Handle missing values by filling nulls appropriately.
   - Create new calculated features to enrich the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Investigate patterns, trends, and relationships among the player attributes such as overall rating, age, and market value.
   - Use statistical and visual exploration techniques to derive insights from the data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot scatter plots to examine the relationship between players' overall ratings, age, and their market value.
   - Create pie charts to analyze the distribution of left-footed and right-footed players.
   - Develop custom visualizations, including scatter plots, to analyze players' growth over time.
   - Compare top 5 players in each position based on their market value in Euros.

By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand how to clean and prepare a real-world dataset for analysis.
- Apply data exploration techniques to uncover insights from player statistics.
- Use data visualization methods to interpret and present your findings effectively.


This project is designed to enhance your understanding of data exploration techniques and visualization skills using a fun and engaging dataset based on the **FIFA 20** video game. Whether you're a football fan or a data enthusiast, this project will help you refine your data science skills while exploring player performance statistics.
